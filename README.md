# MedianOfMedian
The Median of Median algorithm uses an asymptotically optimal approximate median selection algorithm to make an asymptotically optimal
general search algorithm. It finds the approximate median in linear time which is then used as pivot in the quickselect algorithm. This approximate median can be used as pivot in Quicksort, giving an optimal sorting algorithm that has worstcase complexity O(n log n)
